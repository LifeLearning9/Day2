**Day 2**
**Given a string s, reverse the order of words.**
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

**Note**:s may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Reduce multiple spaces between words to a single space in the output.

**Example Test Cases**
Test Case 1:
Input:
s = "the sky is blue"
Output:
"blue is sky the"

Test Case 2:
Input:
s = " hello world "
Output:
"world hello"
